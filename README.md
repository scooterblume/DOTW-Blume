Final Project for Drawing on the Web


# Outline
For my drawing on the web final project I would like to incorporate video games into the three full-browser drawings. I would like them to increase in complication as you move through the website. An example of this would be for the first page to be a game like snake and the second to be a picture puzzle and the third an even more complicated and possibly 3D game/puzzle. I would make it so the user couldnâ€™t progress through the website unless they beat the current game. In a sense, you would need to unlock the website. 
The first page would either be a snake-like game or pong. I would use P5.js for this and a full-page canvas. It would look different than normal snake, perhaps there would be obstacles in the way. You would complete the game by reaching a certain point, or growing the snake to a certain length (not by filling the entire screen with the snake, that would take too long/ be too hard).
The second page would be some sort of puzzle where you need to reveal an image/drawing by moving around the pieces of it. It would then turn into a button to move onto the next page. 
The final page would need to be even more complicated than the first two. P5 offers a package called P5.play that extends the library to offer more gaming related options. I would use this to make some sort of side scroller game (still moderately simple but harder to solve than the first two).
